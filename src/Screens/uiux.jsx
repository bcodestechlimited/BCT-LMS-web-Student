                  The Evolution of UI/UX Design: <br /> UI/UX design has come a
                  long way since the early days of the internet. In the past,
                  coding was a necessary skill for anyone aspiring to enter the
                  field of UI/UX design. You are probably asking out loud what a
                  no-code tool is? No-code tools are software applications that
                  allow individuals to create websites, web applications, and
                  mobile applications without writing a single line of code.
                  These tools come with pre-built templates, drag-and-drop
                  features, and intuitive interfaces that make them accessible
                  for anyone with creative ideas to bring their visions to life.
                  However, with the advent of no-code tools, the landscape has
                  changed dramatically.
